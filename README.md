# Music Search App

####  Search for any song and listen to 30-second previews using the iTunes API â€” all from your browser!

#### By **Gladys Achando**

## Description

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for any song or artist and listen to 30-second audio previews directly in the browser. The app fetches music data from the iTunes Search API and displays key information such as the song title, artist name, album artwork, and an audio player.

Since the iTunes API does not support cross-origin requests from the browser, the app uses a local CORS proxy server (cors-anywhere) to fetch data safely. This makes it a great learning project for understanding APIs, working with fetch, and handling CORS issues in JavaScript.
